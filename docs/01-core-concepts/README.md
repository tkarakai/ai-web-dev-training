# Core Concepts

This section covers the foundational knowledge needed to work effectively with LLMs. Understanding these concepts enables you to make informed decisions about model selection, prompt design, and system architecture.

## Topics

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [LLM Mechanics](./llm-mechanics.md) | Tokens, context windows, sampling, determinism, and the open-source vs proprietary trade-off |
| [Prompting and Interaction Patterns](./prompting.md) | Instruction design, debugging prompts, and agent loops |
| [Context Management](./context-management.md) | Providing effective context, managing long conversations, and LLM-friendly documentation |
| [MCP Protocol Overview](./mcp-protocol.md) | Model Context Protocol fundamentals, primitives, and security considerations |

## Prerequisites

None. Start here if you're new to AI-assisted development.

## Reading Order

Read in order for a complete foundation, or jump to specific topics as needed:

1. **LLM Mechanics** — Start here to understand how models work
2. **Prompting** — How to communicate effectively with models
3. **Context Management** — How to provide the right information
4. **MCP Protocol** — How tools connect to models (can be skipped initially, return when needed)
