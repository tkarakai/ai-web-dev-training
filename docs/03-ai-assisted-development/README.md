# AI-Assisted Development

This section covers practical workflows for using AI to build software faster and safer. These patterns apply whether you're writing new code, debugging, refactoring, or reviewing changes.

## Topics

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Tooling Ecosystem and Setup](./tooling-ecosystem.md) | IDE copilots, CLI agents, local models, and tool selection strategy |
| [Day-to-Day Workflows](./day-to-day-workflows.md) | Scaffolding, refactoring, debugging, vibe coding, and spec-driven development |
| [Testing and Quality with AI](./testing-quality.md) | Generating tests, property-based testing, and mutation-inspired prompting |
| [AI-Assisted Technical Writing](./technical-writing.md) | RFCs, ADRs, API docs, runbooks, and spec-to-checklist workflows |
| [Code Review and Governance Practices](./code-review-governance.md) | Review prompts, team standards, and agent steering via AGENTS.md |

## Prerequisites

Complete [Core Concepts](../01-core-concepts/README.md) and skim [Governance](../02-governance/README.md) first.
