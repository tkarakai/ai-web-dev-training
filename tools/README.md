# Tools

This directory contains practical guides, tips, and documentation for AI-assisted development tools.

## Purpose

Quick-reference materials for senior developers using AI tools in their daily workflow. Not comprehensive manuals—focused on what you need to be productive.

When adding tool documentation:
- Focus on practical usage, not feature lists
- Include real examples and common patterns
- Note limitations and gotchas
- Keep it scannable—headings, tables, code blocks
