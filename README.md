# Building Software with Generative AI

This repository is my collection of topics I've encountered and found interesting while developing software alongside generative AI. It's not a curriculum or training program—it's a curated set of experiences, patterns, and gotchas I've run into while learning to work effectively with LLMs, agents, and AI-powered tools.

## Why This Exists

Over the past few years, I've been deep in the trenches with AI-assisted development: using copilots and CLI agents, developing production features with LLM backends, and navigating the chaos of a rapidly evolving ecosystem. This repo is where I've documented the stuff I wish someone had told me earlier—the things you only learn by running into them.

## What's Inside

The [/docs](/docs) folder contains detailed guides organized into four main areas:

1. **[Core Concepts](/docs/01-core-concepts/)** — How LLMs actually work: tokens, context windows, prompting patterns, agentic workflows, and the MCP protocol
2. **[Governance](/docs/02-governance/)** — The non-technical stuff that matters: policies, bias/harms, legal/IP considerations, and when not to use AI
3. **[AI-Assisted Development](/docs/03-ai-assisted-development/)** — Day-to-day workflows for building software faster: tooling, refactoring, debugging, testing, and code review practices
4. **[Shipping AI Features](/docs/04-shipping-ai-features/)** — Production system design: RAG, evals, security, observability, multi-agent orchestration, and voice interfaces

Each guide is structured to be practical and reference-friendly, with TL;DRs, core concepts, common pitfalls, and related topics.

## How to Use This

**If you're new to AI-assisted development:** Start with Core Concepts, then move to Governance and AI-Assisted Development. These will give you the foundational knowledge and safety habits before you start shipping AI features.

**If you're already using AI tools and want to ship AI features:** Skim Core Concepts and Governance for shared vocabulary, then jump into Shipping AI Features for production patterns.

**If you're looking for something specific:** The [main index](/docs/README.md) has a complete topic breakdown with direct links to each guide.

## What This Is Not

This isn't an official best practices guide or a definitive resource. It's my working notes, made public in case they're useful to others. The AI space moves fast—some of this will age poorly, and I'm okay with that. Think of it as advice from a fellow engineer who's been down this path, not gospel.

This is a personal knowledge base, so I'm not actively soliciting contributions. That said, if you spot something that's wrong or outdated, feel free to open an issue. I'd rather be corrected than confidently wrong.
